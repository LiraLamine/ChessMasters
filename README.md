Augmented Reality Chess Program

The AR testing program will be called "Droido", and it involves projecting a small field onto a physical target. On the field are ramps, and a ball which will roll down those ramps.
There is currently no way to exit the program on an android phone other than forcing it closed. Keep this in mind.
