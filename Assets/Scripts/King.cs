    //(a) Except when castling, the king moves to any adjoining square that is not attacked by an opponent's piece.
    //(b) Castling is a move of the king and either rook, counting as a single move of the king and executed as follows: the king is transferred from 
    //its original square two squares toward either rook on the same rank; then that rook is transferred over the king to the square the king has just crossed.
    //  (e) Castling is [permanently] illegal:
    //    (i) if the king has already been moved; or
    //    (ii) with a rook that has already been moved.
    //  (f) Castling is prevented for the time being:
    //    (i) if the king's original square, or the square which the king must pass over, or that which it is to occupy, is attacked by an opponent's piece; or
    //    (ii) if there is any piece between the king and the rook with which castling is to be effected[i.e.castling may still be legal even if the rook is attacked or, 
    //          when castling queenside, passes over an attacked square] .
